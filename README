TODOS:

TOP PRIORITY
-- Implement Refresh Token to front end
-- the Nearby Page is still really buggy.  Got to fix this
-- Push Notification when someone collects your message.
-- Make the swiping more fluid - like spotify
-- CORS?

-- Make it so you have to log in to use the app.
-- Make sure to handle the cases where a user's token expire in the middle of using the app/ the refresh token retrieval doesnt work.


Not So Urgent
-- Collectables
-- Profile Tab w/ Logout button
-- tab to see your own messages, and perhaps metadata bout your message
-- Index the location column?
-- currently polling every 5 seconds, see if theres a better way to do this.
-- Message Expiry
-- Keep metadata about how many times a message has been collected?
-- Friends List
-- Achievements
-- Different type of messages
-- Subscription Model
-- loading screen

-- test the relationship stuff, i dont quite understand it
